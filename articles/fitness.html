            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">To put it simply, physical activity and exercise is important for everyone. Children, adolescents, and adults of all ages need regular physical activity. Physical activity promotes good health, and you should stay active throughout all stages
                of your life regardless of your body type or BMI.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Understanding the benefits of physical fitness and knowing how active you should be can help you maintain good health and improve your overall quality of life. Here are a few benefits of regular physical activity that demonstrate the importance
                of physical fitness.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Save money</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic diseases cause 7 out of 10 deaths in the U.S., and treating chronic diseases accounts for 86% of U.S. healthcare costs. While some diseases cannot be prevented, you can reduce
                your risk for certain disease – such as heart disease and diabetes – through reducing risky behaviors and living a healthy lifestyle. Making healthy choices, such as engaging in regular physical activity, can reduce your risk for many
                health issues and complications that can result in expensive medical care.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Increase your life expectancy</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Numerous studies have shown that regular physical activity increases life expectancy and reduces the risk of premature mortality. There’s not a magic formula that translates hours of physical activity into hours of life gained, but research
                suggests that people who are more active tend to be healthier and tend to live longer.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Reduce your risk of injury</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5"> Regular exercise and physical activity increase muscle strength, bone density, flexibility, and stability. Physical fitness can reduce your risk for and resilience to accidental injuries, especially as you get older. For example, stronger
                muscles and better balance mean that you’re less likely to slip and fall, and stronger bones mean that your less likely to suffer bone injuries should you take a tumble.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Improve your quality of life</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5"> A sedentary lifestyle and a lack of physical activity can take a toll on a person’s body. Physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, numerous chronic diseases, and mental health issues. Exercise,
                however, has been shown to improve mood and mental health, and provides numerous health benefits. Of course physical fitness also allows you to do things that you may not otherwise be able to do.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Stay active</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5"> Staying active and healthy allows you to do activities that require a certain level of physical fitness. For example, hiking to the top of a mountain is a rewarding experience that instills a sense of accomplishment and provides spectacular
                scenery, but there are people who cannot experience this due to fitness limitations. But even walking around the zoo with your family or playing on the playground with your children can be challenging for those who neglect physical activity
                for extended periods of time. Being active means that it’s easier to stay active as you get older.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h5>Improve your health</h5>
                    <p>There are numerous health advantages to physical fitness. Regular exercise and physical activity promotes strong muscles and bones. It improves respiratory, cardiovascular health, and overall health. Staying active can also help you
                        maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and reduce your risk for some cancers. In other words, staying active is a crucial part of maintaining good health and wellness.</p>
                    <p>Encourage your family to be more active, and challenge yourself to meet daily or weekly physical activity goals. Play outdoor sports with the whole family, schedule time each day to go to the gym, or pick up healthy, active hobbies
                        like hiking or cycling. National Physical Fitness and Sports Month is a great time to get more active, but don’t stop at the end of the month. Make exercise and physical activity a permanent part of your daily routine!</p>
