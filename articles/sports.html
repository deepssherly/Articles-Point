            <hr>
            <h6 class="text-muted text-end me-5">- By Daniel Francis Perkins</h6>

            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Sports can be a fun and engaging way for children and youth to learn some important lessons about life. Studies suggest that participation in sports can be very beneficial, fostering responsible social behaviors, greater academic success,
                and an appreciation of personal health and fitness. Participating on a team also can give children or youth an important sense of belonging.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">The atmosphere set by organizations, parents, and coaches is a major factor in deter-mining whether or not youth will have a positive experience in a sports program. A “win-at-all-costs" atmosphere can be harmful to a developing youth. This
                bulletin is the first in a two-part series written to assist parents in fostering a positive climate that enables children and youth involved in sports to enjoy them-selves and reach their full potential. It focuses on the benefits and
                risks of youth sports, discusses parents as role models, and provides practical tips for parents. The second bulletin addresses the issue of parents as spectators and consumers of organized youth sports. A related bulletin provides advice
                for coaches. Few children possess the talent to play competitive sports at the highest level—most will not grow up to be professional athletes. Therefore, in this series, we take the perspective that the primary goals of youth sports are
                to foster the development of general physical competence and to promote physical activity, fun, life skills, sportsmanship, and good health. Sports that foster personal competence help youth develop their abilities to do life planning,
                to be self-reliant, and to seek the resources of others when needed.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Benefits of Sports for Children and Youth</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Sports are opportunities for children and youth to learn; they provide a “practice field" for life. For example, learning to work as a team teaches young children social skills that will help them in their growth as people, not just as athletes.
                For youth, participating in sports may develop teamwork, leadership, self-confidence, self-discipline, and coping skills. Sports also can teach youth about sportsmanlike behaviors and respect for authority. In fact, according to a survey
                of teachers and school administrators, youth that participated in sports had better grades and behaved better in the classroom because of the associated discipline and work ethic. The evidence from research is clear—children and youth
                who are involved in physical activities such as sports fare better in school, have higher social skills, are more team-oriented, and are healthier as determined by fitness standards.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Risks of Athletic Participation</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Participation in sports also has the potential to be a negative experience for youth, depending on the program's atmosphere. This atmosphere has nothing to do with winning or losing; rather, it depends on how the coaches and parents handle
                themselves, and the philosophy of the sports program organization. A child who is exposed to repeated failures and who receives criticism without useful feedback is not likely to thrive within the youth sports environment. A lack of positive
                role models and pressures to perform also can create a negative atmosphere. The influence of a negative climate is demonstrated by one study that examined approximately 5,800 children who recently stopped playing a sport. The researchers
                found that the top five reasons for stopping were “loss of interest," “not having fun," “too much time required," “coach was a poor teacher," and “too much pressure." Fortunately, there are ways to avoid these risks and create a positive
                atmosphere in a sports program. Parents should enroll their youth in programs that have clear positive goals about the sports experience, emphasizing fair play and sportsmanship as well as the skills to be taught and the lessons to be
                learned. With these goals, the “winning at all cost" attitude that leads to a negative atmosphere is held in check, and the learning process is emphasized.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Parents as Adult Role Models</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5"> Children and youth learn “how to play the game" from their coaches and parents. These adults are important teachers and role models, and the atmosphere they create determines whether a child's sports experience is negative or positive. For
                example, parents and coaches may have goals for the youth different from those of the youth themselves. Regardless of these goals, it is critical for parents to nurture the youth's ambitions. Parents and coaches must continuously communicate
                with youth to assist them and support their dreams.</p>

                    <p>Parents should play an important role in their children's sports experiences. They can introduce their children to a sport by playing with them. During the preschool and elementary years, helping children develop basic skills such
                        as running, jumping, kicking, and throwing is important for later skill development. During this time, sports should be focused on cooperative games that provide children a chance to explore their skills and talents and develop
                        a sense of success. The emphasis should be on fun, not competition. At this age, children are not yet prepared to understand winning and losing. Children think losing says something negative about them personally. Putting youth
                        at this age in highly competitive situations may be detrimental to their development. Parents need to provide encouragement and praise for effort, not for winning. To foster a child's learning, parents should provide encouragement
                        and direction about a specific skill.</p>

                            Develop in your child a lifelong commitment to an active lifestyle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Encourage your child to try various physical activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Encourage your child to play because he or she enjoys it, not because it may get him or her a scholarship. Intrinsic motivation is a key ingredient for lifelong commitment to physical fitness.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Communicate with your child's coaches. Be involved in the sports program and seek out coaches that have a positive philosophy focused on skill building.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Focus on teaching life skills, and allow your child to be involved in the decision making about sports participation. Reinforce and support your child's decisions.
