            <hr>
            <h6 class="text-muted text-end me-5">- By Carissa Stephens</h6>

            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">What is music therapy?</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Sound healing therapy uses aspects of music to improve physical and emotional health and well-being. The person being treated partakes in the experience with a trained practitioner. Music therapy may involve:</p>
            <ul class="mt-4 mx-5">
                <li>listening to music</li>
                <li>singing along to music</li>
                <li>moving to the beat of the music</li>
                <li>meditating</li>
                <li>playing an instrument</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Healing with sound is believed to date back to ancient Greece, when music was used in an attempt to cure mental disorders. Throughout history, music has been used to boost morale in military troops, help people work faster and more productively,
                and even ward off evil spirits by chanting. More recently, research has linked music to a number of health benefits, from boosting immune function and lowering stress levels to improving the health of premature babies.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Types of sound or music therapy</h5>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Guided meditation</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">in a session or class, or using a video or app. Meditation can involve chanting or repeating mantras or prayers. ResearchTrusted Source has found that meditation offers a number of health benefits, including: stress reduction decreased anxiety
                and depression improved memory reduced blood pressure pain reduction lower cholesterol decreased risk of heart disease and stroke</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Neurologic music therapy</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Music therapy can reduce stress and promote relaxation. It’s been shown to be more effective than prescription drugs in reducing anxiety levels before surgery. A study published in 2017 found that a 30-minute music therapy session combined
                with traditional care after spinal surgery reduced pain. Music therapy is administered by a credentialed provider who assesses the individual’s needs. Treatment involves creating, listening, singing, or moving to music. It’s used for physical
                rehab, pain management, and brain injuries.
            </p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Bonny Method</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5"> Named after Helen L. Bonny, PhD, the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (GIM) classical music and imagery to help explore personal growth, consciousness, and transformation. A 2017 study showed promising evidence that a series of GIM
                sessions could improve psychological and physiological health in adults with medical and mental health needs.</p>
            <h5 class="mt-4 mx-5">Tuning fork therapy</h5>
            <p class="mt-4 mx-5">Tuning fork therapy uses calibrated metal tuning forks to apply specific vibrations to different parts of the body. This can help release tension and energy, and promote emotional balance. It supposedly works similarly to acupuncture, using
                sound frequencies for point stimulation instead of needles. There is some research suggesting that tuning fork therapy may help relieve muscle and bone pain.</p>

                    <h5>Brainwave entrainment</h5>
                    <p> Also known as binaural beats, this method stimulates the brain into a specific state using pulsing sound to encourage your brain waves to align to the frequency of the beat. It’s supposed to help induce enhanced focus, entranced state,
                        relaxation, and sleep. Though more research is needed, there’s some evidenceTrusted Source that audible brainwave entrainment reduces anxiety, pain, and symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, as well as improves behavioral problems
                        in children.</p>
